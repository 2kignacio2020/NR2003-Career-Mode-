# NR2003-Career-Mode-
Project designed to get the max out of nr2003, this should be aplicable to iracing too but I am not quite sure
The project would let you have different modes:
Driver
Owner
Manufacter
It should be compatible
Also when you start a new game it must let you create a new databse(drivers and schedule) or choose a default one
then generate offer
then you should be able to put results manually or take the results file from the game
and when a season it should let you generate new offers or stay or kick you out if you race bad
and then repeat the process

Future features:
Add Xfinity and truck(future ARCA)
Lets you as a manager and an owner start without a team
team goals, drivers and teams relationships
and automatic changes for not make it yourself in game
Generates news
and much more meanwhile we do things i add new to make it better
